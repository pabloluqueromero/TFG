from NaiveBayes import NaiveBayes

'''
Load/Generate Data Set
Define number of variables and states
'''


'''
Feature Construction Process Cartesian Product
Use crossvalidation
1- Simple NB crossvalidation get best variable
2- Add variables to see if it improves
3- Construct Variables
'''


'''
It is probs a good idea to add methods to NaiveBayes such as:
    1.- Remove feature
    2.- Add feature
    3.- Keep coherence when removing or adding variables, perhaps adding optional parameter with names might help
    4.- Add lots of checks to see if correct shape, data is what we expect no foreign data is added
